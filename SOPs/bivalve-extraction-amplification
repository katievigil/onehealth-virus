1.  **SCOPE AND APPLICATION**

This method is used to extract DNA/RNA viruses from bivalves for random
PCR amplification and sequencing analysis with the Nanopore MinION
portable real-time sequencing device or equivalent.

2.  **SUMMARY OF METHOD**

Bivalve hepatopancreas samples will be homogenized using 5 mm stainless
steel grinding balls in elution buffer. The homogenized mixture is
centrifuged down and the supernatant will be treated with DNase and
RNase enzymes to degrade background DNA and/or RNA. Ceres Nanotrap beads
are added to the enzyme treated samples, and final extraction will be
conducted using the Qiagen All-Prep Viral kit. RNA and DNA isolated
samples will be reverse transcribed using a random hexamer, then DNA
will be amplified randomly amplified for library sequencing preparation
using a different SOP.

4.  **SAFETY**

    4.1.  Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including
        lab coats, gloves, eye protection and face shield, as needed.

    4.2.  All procedures that can cause infection from aerosols or
        splashes are performed within a biological safety cabinet (BSC).

    4.3.  Make sure all BSC cabinets are UV'd before use and countertops
        are wiped down with RNA-Away and/or DNA-away before proceeding
        with sample processing.

    4.4.  Process environmental samples in a separate hood to reagent
        prep.

    4.5.  Use an autoclave or an alternative method of decontamination for
        proper disposals.

    4.6.  A sink and eyewash station should be readily available.

        bivalve samples as a negative control during homogenization
        process.

    8.6.  Sterile elution water will be processed concurrently with
        bivalve samples as a negative control during extraction process.
    
    8.7. All negative controls will be sequencing and excluded from final reads.

        homogenization with grinding balls.

        8.9.1.  +ssRNA MS2 RNA phage stock is an intact virus with its
            > capsid. It will have the same behavior as other RNA
            > viruses within their encapsules. 

        8.9.2.  Measure recovery with RT-dPCR or RT-PCR and sequencing.

9.  **CALIBRATION AND STANDARDIZATION**

    9.1.  Calibrate the Invitrogen Qubit 4 Fluorometer according to the
        manufacturer\'s instructions (Qubit™ 4 Fluorometer Manual
        Revision C.0).

10. **PROCEDURE**

    10.1.  **Bivalve Sample Processing**

    10.2.  **TURN ON THE** 37^o^C and 55^o^C water bathd. Put the PM-1
        buffer in the 55^o^C cleaned water bath or incubator until
        extraction.

    10.3.  Measure height and width of each bivalve (cm) and record in lab
        notebook before dissecting.

    10.4.  Place 50 mL conical tube on a scale and add 4 grinding balls
        then tare the scale and it is ready for tissue samples.

    10.5.  Dissect hepatopancreas from 5 oysters, mussels or clams and pool
        samples into one UV sterilized 50 mL conical tube. When
        processing clams or mussels, more hepatopancreas can be added to
        the 50 mL conical tube, do not add more than 15 mL of tissue at
        a time.

    10.6.  Fill the 50mL conical tube up to 30 mL elution solution
        (**Section 6.1**) and close cap firmly.

    10.7.  Vortex diluted samples for **1 hour at max speed (level 10)** at
        4^o^C using the Fisherbrand Analog Vortex Mixer (it is better
        than the Vortex-Genie 2) and the 50 mL adaptor.

    10.8.  Centrifuge sample at **3,273g for 10 minutes at 4^o^C**, to
        pellet large homogenized particles down.

    10.9.  Without disturbing the pellet, pipette the supernatant off and
        transfer to 200 mL flat bottom plastic conical tubes that have
        been sterilized and UV'd.

    10.10. Centrifuge the 200 mL sample at (14,000 rpm) **30,074 g at 4^o^C
        for 45 minutes**.

    10.11. Transfer supernatant to a 15 mL conical tube for viral
        extraction, or store at -80C.

    10.12. **Allprep PowerViral DNA/RNA Kit and Viral Enrichment**

    10.13. Transfer 170uL of concentrated sample to 1.5mL tube and add 30
        uL enzyme treatment mix from Section 10.15.

Note: Manuscript from (Li et al., 2015; Victoria et al., 2008; Victoria et
al., 2009): The viral multiplex reagent (200 µL) was centrifuged at
12.000×g for 5min at 8 °C and the supernatant filtered through a 0.45 µM
filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) to remove possible host cellular
debris and bacteria. The filtrate was treated with a nuclease mixture of
14 U turbo DNase (Ambion, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), 3U
Baseline-ZERO (Epicentre, Chicago, IL, USA) and 20 U RNase One (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) in1×DNase buffer (Ambion, Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY, USA) at 37 °C for 1.5 h to reduce background nucleic acids
from the host cells and bacteria. Viral nucleic acids protected from
digestion by viral capsids, were then extracted from ∼200 µL resulting
solutions by different methods (Victoria etal.,2008,2009).

10.15. **RNA Extraction Using the Qiagen Allprep Viral Kit**

10.16. Add 200uL of enzyme treated viral concentrate and 600uL of Solution
    PM1 to 1.5mL collection tube. Vortex mixture for 30s and incubate at
    55^o^C on a heat block for viral lysis for 5 minutes.

10.17. Add 150 uL of Solution IRS and vortex briefly to mix. Incubate at
    4^o^ C for 5 min.

10.18. Centrifuge the tubes at 13,000 x g for 1 min. Avoiding the pellet,
    transfer the supernatant to a clean 2.2 mL Collection Tube. Do not
    transfer more than 700 uL.

10.19. Add 600 uL each of Solution PM3 and Solution PM4 to a 2.2mL
    centrifuge tube (you should mix this together in a tube, then add to
    2.2mL tubes).

10.20. Vortex Briefly to mix and briefly spin down.

Note: you can premix these solutions together in a conical tube of
easier pipetting.

10.21. Load 625 uL of super natant onto a MB Spin Column and centrifuge at
    13,000 x g for 1 min. Discard the flow through and repeat until all
    the supernatant has been loaded onto the Spin Column. Note: A total
    of 3 loads is required for each sample processed.

10.22. Shake and mix Solution PM5 and add 600 uL to MB Spin Column.
    Centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 1 min.

10.23. Discard flow through. Add 600 uL of Solution PM4. Centrifuge at
    13,000 x g for 1 min.

10.24. Discard flow through and centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 2 min.

10.25. Place the MB Spin Column into a clean 2 mL Collection Tube
    (provided).

10.26. Add 100uL of RNase-free water to the center of the white column
    membrane and incubate for at lease 1 min. Note: Eluting with 100uL
    of RNase-free water will maximize DNA/RNA yield. For more
    concentrated DNA/RNA, **a minimum of 50 uL of RNase-free water can
    be used.**

**Note: I have seen higher DNA concentrations on Qubit eluting with only
50 uL.**

10.27. Centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 1 min. Discard the MB Spin Column. The
    DNA/RNA is now reading for downstream applications and should be
    aliquoted into smaller volumes and stored at -80C.

10.28. *Note: Multiple freeze-thaw cycles may cause degradation*.

[The PCR products were purified by Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman
Coulter, Brea, CA, United States) with 0.8:1 ratio of beads to
sample]{.mark}.

10.38 Clean up the cDNA produce 2x with 1x or 1.8x bead clean up. Check
cDNA product on Tapestation or Bioanalyzer and nanodrop 260/280 and
260/230.

260/280: assess the purity of DNA or RNA by comparing the absorbance at
260 nm (where nucleic acids absorb light) to the absorbance at 280 nm
(where proteins absorb light). A ratio around 1.8 for DNA and 2.0 for
RNA is considered pure, indicating minimal protein contamination.

260/230: to evaluate the presence of contaminants such as phenol,
guanidine, carbohydrates, or other organic molecules that may absorb at
230 nm. A ratio around 2.0 is ideal for DNA, while 1.8 is for RNA.
